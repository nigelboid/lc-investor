LCRequest class and scripts for automatic investing, withdrawals, and reports

I have not documented the API or the scripts, yet. Be cautious before you commit real money!
- Read the example scripts
- Read the LCRequest code
- Run the code in --simulation and --debug modes
- Obtain an API key from LendingClub and note your account number (investor ID)

Thanks to Jeremy Gillick and Jeremy Foote for inspiration.

I had initially planned to create a script for detailed reporting,
but chose instead to pull data directly into Google Spreadsheets for analysis.
